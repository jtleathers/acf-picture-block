# ACF Picture Block
This is a guide for adding an ACF custom block that outputs an HTML picture element. It is intended to be completed following the in-class exercise during the FWDP 3600 course.

In your mindset-blocks/src folder run the following command and create a dynamic block:
`npx @wordpress/create-block@latest --no-plugin`

Don't worry about the answers to the questions in the terminal, you will replace the files with these files in this repo:
 - block.json
 - render.php
 - style.scss

In the terminal run this command:
`npm run build`

Now you can import the ACF field group. Use this provided file: 
 - acf-picture-field-group.json

Test it out! Modify it! Make it better!
